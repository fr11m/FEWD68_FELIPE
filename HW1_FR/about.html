  <hr />

  <p> I am an aspiring front-end web designer. I started
    <br />dabbling in web design a few months back. Now it
    <br />has become a hobby for me. I am looking to turn this
    <br /> new hobby into a career. General Assembly is helping me
    <br />immerse myself in web design and turn this hobby into a carreer</p>
